Summarization Pipeline

Scientific Paper Summarization Pipeline

Description

This pipeline implements an automated system for summarizing scientific papers.
It processes academic papers that are converted locally from PDF to XML using the GROBID model, extracts their textual content, and generates a structured academic summary using the BART-Large-CNN language model.

Workflow Overview
	1.	Input
	•	XML file generated locally from a scientific PDF using GROBID.
	2.	Text Extraction
	•	Extracts paper metadata (title, authors, date).
	•	Extracts text from the abstract and body sections using BeautifulSoup.
	3.	Text Preprocessing
	•	Cleans the extracted text by removing extra spaces and citation references.
	•	Prepares the text for model input.
	4.	Text Chunking
	•	Splits long text into smaller chunks (≈450 words) to meet model input limits.
	5.	Summarization
	•	Uses the pre-trained facebook/bart-large-cnn model via Hugging Face.
	•	Generates summaries for each chunk.
	•	Combines all chunk summaries into a single summary.
	6.	Structured Summary Generation
	•	Divides the final summary into academic sections:
	•	Introduction
	•	Problem
	•	Proposed Method
	•	Key Contributions
	•	Experimental Results
	•	Conclusion
	7.	Output
	•	TXT file containing the structured summary.
	•	HTML file for clean and readable web presentation.

⸻

Evaluation Method
	•	No quantitative metrics (e.g., accuracy or ROUGE) were used.
	•	Evaluation was performed qualitatively by comparing the generated summaries with the original scientific paper to assess clarity and relevance.

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	BeautifulSoup
	•	Hugging Face Transformers
	•	BART-Large-CNN
	•	Regular Expressions (text cleaning)

⸻

Notes
	•	PDF-to-XML conversion is performed locally using GROBID.
	•	Designed for academic  and research use.
